Monitor sensors on arduinos with an android app on a PandaBoard running our custom Android system.

#Description

Sensors are gathering data (temperature, light, ...) in different places of a building. Using a ZigBee wireless network, data are sent to a server which stores information in a database. Then, an android board with an app is used to display data by asking the server.

This project uses the following technologies:
* Arduino
* ZigBee
* Android
* Node.Js
* MongoDB
* PandaBoard
* TinkerKit

#Installation
